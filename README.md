WPI (Weapon Port Infopedia), program by HitmanVere and MakeCents.

WPI is a Single File/Offline access to info that is required for perfecting weapon ports for Call of Duty maps and mods.

Current features include:
- Firetime calculator
    - Type in weapon's RPM and you are given value for weaponfile.
- State timer calculator
    - For acquiring value for an animation's time (good for ports that don't have accessable weaponfiles) Type FPS/Frame count for value (Remember: This value can be different to actual value in that game's weaponfile, this is only to get more accurate value than guessing)
- Wiki. Options include:
    - What joints to export when doing animations
    - Texture names and what they are used for
    - Fixing Normal maps
    - Adding attachment onto a model
    - Infinite Warfare combined textures and extracting properly
- Additional info tab for useful links
