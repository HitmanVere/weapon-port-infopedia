WPI (Weapon Port Infopedia), program by HitmanVere and MakeCents.

WPI is a Single File/Offline access to info that is required for perfecting weapon ports for Call of Duty custom maps and mods.

Current features include:
- *_Firetime calculator_*
    - Type in weapon's RPM (Rounds Per Minute) and you are given value for weaponfile.
- *_State timer calculator_*
    - For acquiring value for an animation's time (good for ports that don't have accessable weaponfiles) Type FPS/Frame count for value (Remember: This value can be different to actual value in that game's weaponfile, this is only to get more accurate value than guessing)
- *_FOV to Focal Length and vice versa calculator_*
    - Instead of FOV settings, Black Ops 3 uses Focal Length for zooming in ADS with snipers. With the calculator you can convert it simply from FOV to FL and other way around.
- *_Weapon 2 Upgrade (W2U for short)_*
    - Weapon 2 Upgrade is a handy drag and drop system where you can drop your Black Ops 3 GDT and have the program generate generic Pack-a-Punch weaponfile for you based on regular weaponfile. All the changes listed inside W2U Info-tab.
- *_Weapon Converter_*
    - Weapon Converter is a tool created by Azsry long time ago that let's you load in older weaponfiles and tool will automatically make Black Ops 3 version of it to be used. All the info listed inside WC Info-tab.
- *_Wiki. Options include:_*
    - What joints to export when doing animations and what to select when doing an animation model.
    - Texture names and what they are used for.
    - Fixing not proper/exported Normal maps.
    - Adding attachment onto a model, Maya and APE ways included.
    - Infinite Warfare combined textures and extracting properly/Camo tutorial.
    - Setting up Dual Wield/Alt weapons for Black Ops 3.
- *_Additional information tab for useful links_*
